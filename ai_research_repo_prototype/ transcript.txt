* Douglas Holland manages sequencing workflow for tissue, blood samples
* Process: library quants (TCANS for long read/WGS, qPCR/TapeStation) → sequencer loading if quants pass
* Team performance measured on turnaround time (TAT)
* Daily volume: ~6 plates processed, typically 1-2 plates have failed samples
Major Pain Point: LOPS Sample Rejection Process
* Individual sample rejection takes 4 minutes per sample (96 samples per plate)
* Failed samples require manual processing one by one:
   * Click each sample individually
   * Select “reject sample” (2-3 minutes each)
   * Create TMP dispositions individually
   * Fail assays individually
* Entire plate failure = 2+ hours of manual work
* Bulk actions don’t work despite UI suggesting they should
* IT aware of issue since January launch, no resolution timeline
System Reliability Issues
* LOPS launched January 2025 with Douglas’s team as first users
* Hot fixes often break previously working functionality for 2-3 weeks
* Occasional system crashes require EPS tickets, samples held until resolution
* BioMax equipment has bottom leg issues
Workflow Workarounds
